The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it. In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.

    p.content-header {
    border: 3px solid coral;
    padding: 10px;
    }

The code in this example puts 10 pixels of space between the content of the paragraph (the text) and the borders, on all four sides.

The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make the content look less cramped.

If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box’s content, you can use the following properties:

    - padding-top
    - padding-right
    - padding-bottom
    - padding-left

Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box’s content, giving you more flexibility in customization.

    p.content-header {
    border: 3px solid fuchsia;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
    }

In the example above, only the bottom side of the paragraph’s content will have a padding of 10 pixels.
