        When using percentages ot size the padding and width properties, dimensions are set relative to the width of parent element of the elemnt whose dimensions are being set.

Assume the default font size of a browser is 12 pixels. The following code will size the paragraphâ€™s text to how many pixels?

p {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

    18 pixels

        12px (the p element's starting font-size which was inherited from the root element) * 1.5em (multiple of the p element's starting font-size) = 18px

What is the difference between an em and a rem?

    An en sizes relative to the current element's font-size or inherited base font-size, whereas rem sizes relative to the root element's font-size. 

        em sizes relative to the current font-size of the element, either its explicitly set font-size or its inherited base font-size if font-size is not explicitly set. rems however, size relative to the root element's font-size.

The following code will size all h1 elements in "splash-section" to how many pixels?

html {
  font-size: 12px;
}

.splash-section {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.splash-section h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

    24 pixels

        16px (the .splash-seciton h1's starting font-size which was inherited from the .spalsh-section) * 1.5em(multiplte of the .slpash-section h1's starting font-size) = 24px

Which of the following property/value pairs will ensure that the background image of the div in the code below will scale proportionally while filling the entire div?

div {
  background-image: url('#');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  /* ? */
}

    background-size: cover; 

        background-size: cover; ensures that the background image of the div scales as large as possible proportionally to cover the entire element. If the dimensions of the image exceed the dimensions of hte div the image will be cropped, leaving no empty space. 

---

The height property in the code below should be set to which of the following values to ensure that the image remains proportional to its original size?

img {
  width: 500px;
  height: ?
}

    auto

        Setting height to auto ensures that the height of the image will automatically scale proportionally to the explicitly set width.

What are the minimum dimensions of a div with the following properties?

div.container {
  min-height: 150px;
  max-height: 600px;
  min-width: 300px;
  max-width: 900px;
}

    150 pixels tall and 300 pixels wide. 

        min-height sets the minimum height of an element and min-width sets the minimum width of an element. Here, the minimum height of div.container is 150px and the minimum width is 300px. 

---

In the code below, how many pixels should the font size of the root element be set to in order to set the size of main headings to 36 pixels?

html {
  font-size: ?
}

h1 {

When percentages are used to size height and width, dimensions are set relative to which of the following?

    The parent of a child element.

        When using percentages to set the height and width properties, dimensions are relative to the parent element of the elemnt whose dimensions are being set.  

---

The code below will display images in which of the following ways?

.container {
  width: 50%;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.container img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
}

    Images will shrink to the full width of their container, scale proportionally, and display partially if the image dimensions exceed container dimensions. 

        max-width: 100%; makes our .container img element shrink to the full width of the .container element, height: auto; will allow our image to scale proportionally with the width, and the overflow: hidden; property on the .container element ensures that if the image dimensions exceed the container dimensions, the overflowing content will be hidden from view. 

---

What are the maximum dimensions of a div with the following properties?

div.container {
  min-height: 150px;
  max-height: 600px;
  min-width: 300px;
  max-width: 900px;
}

    600 pixels tall and 900 pixels wide. 

        max-height sets the maximum height of an element and max-width sets the maximum width of an element. Here, the maximum height of div.container is 600px and the maximum width is 900px.

---

The following code will set the text of a paragraph inside a .splash-section element to how many pixels?

html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.splash-section {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.splash-section p {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

    24 pixels

        When using rem, use the font size specified in hte html selector. In this case 16 x 1.5 will make the pixel size 24.
